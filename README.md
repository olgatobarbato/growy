GROWY

Track your goals, cultivate your habits. Developing sustainable habits is like planting the seeds of success for lush growth, nourishing yourself and the planet!

Growy is a web application implemented in Next,js, Sass and MongoDB that was created as a gamification of a to-do list, with the intention of turning a simple to-do list into an engaging and motivating experience for personal growth.

The name itself, Growy, suggests this goal and succeeds, through typical game elements, in making it more fun and rewarding to develop positive habits and grow in various aspects of life through small daily steps. Growy's identity also incorporates the theme of sustainability through its colors and naturalistic elements.

With Growy you can set up to 3 types of tasks:

1. Your HABITS: weekly activities to be checked every day, you can track them with the dots and it will restart after 24h of inactivity;
2. Your DAILIES: one-time daily activities, after 24h the task returns unfinished;
3. Your TO-DOS: simple to-dos with a deadline from a calendar.

Each type of activity gives you water, soil, and seed points. These points can be spent in your... garden!

The garden is the place where all your efforts become reality, the nursery of your good habits: you can spend your points to buy trees and enrich it. And when you get tired, you can cut down the trees and grow others, just as you change and improve yourself.

The libraries we used were:

1. date-fns: for the management of the option last completed in the tasks;
2. date-picker: for the calendar present in the modal, thanks to which it is possible to indicate the deadline of the todos;
3. motion-framer: for the implementation of animations that punctuate different elements of our web application; and
4. confetti-explosion: for the Easter egg on the 404 page.

Happy growing!
